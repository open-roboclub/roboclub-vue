The paper deals in detail the system design which is meant to provide a framework for developing useful embedded tools for easy, timely, cheap and accurate detection of heart abnormalities and cardiac murmurs which often go unnoticed in absence of trained physicians. The tagline of the system is its low cost that sets it apart from the peer in the market. A dedicated display unit for displaying the waveforms is bypassed, hence reducing the cost reasonably, instead the computer screen is used as the display unit of system, thus making it possible for further analysis and interpretation. LabVIEW is used for signal analysis, however dedicated software for the sole purpose can be developed in the future.  ",

    "description" : "Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUIs (graphical user interfaces), which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse.\n        Gesture recognition enables humans to communicate with the machine (HMI) and interact naturally without any mechanical devices.\n        Here we are using a accelerometer in conjunction with a MCU and RF link to make a gesture controlled Robot.

Micro SD card supports SPI and so it is interfaced with MicroController Atmega 32. The data is transferred between the memory card and the host controller as data blocks in unit of 512 bytes. data is stored using FAT32 library by elm-chan. Various sensors like temperature sensor (LM35) Pressure Sensor (MPX4115), height sensor (GP2D12) etc are interfaced to MCU using ADC port. To give data according to real time we have used Real Time Clock (RTC) DS1307 . It is interfaced with MCU using I2C protocol. Data received by sensors are directed to MCU where it is processed and directed to micro SD Card with real date and time. Data is stored in CSV format so that we can read the date in Microsoft Excel.

We have subsidized the cost of manufacturing by implementing the support system which is indeed capable of upholding chassis and rail-trolley system. \n\t    The purpose of using the rails is the need for smooth movement of chassis carrying metal plate. The pulley so chosen that it is sufficiently strong to bear the load of metal piece to be electroplated. The supports are fixed at wooden base to provide tough structure to the whole station. All containers so chosen are fixed in separate compartments assigned to wooden base.\n\t    The motors so chosen that they sufficiently check the speed of chassis for its motion from 1 station to another. The motor used for driving blower are so chosen that they sufficiently wipe the extra droplets from metal piece. The motor used for Pulley is heavy as it directs the pulley to uphold the entire weight of metal piece. Also the wooden base is also sufficiently strong enough to bear the entire weight of all sub-stations. The fixed wooden base and rails also provides a means to carry the whole Electroplating Station at once, thus this whole arrangement is mobile from 1 place to another. ",

Depending on the direction of MEMS, Arduino control the wheelchair direction like LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD and BACKWARD. In voice Recognition and manual control system , we use Bluetooth Module .To create a communication between Android mobile phone and Bluetooth module connected to Arduino , an android app has been formed which after successful connection with Bluetooth Module can send data from Android app to Arduino Board which control the wheelchair directions . The system has been designed and implemented in a cost effective way so that if our project is commercialized the needy users in developing countries will benefit from it.",

Road safety is emerging as a major social concern around the world especially in India. Drinking and driving is already a serious public health problem, which is one of the most significant problems. According to the statistics, India reports as many as 1.34 lakh fatalities in road accidents every year, a vast 70 per cent of them being due to drunken driving,  The role of alcohol in traffic safety has produced more controversies than any other topic. Alcohol and driving don't mix, but still, many people love to drink and drive resulting in numerous road mishaps. A drunken driver is a potential murderer as he cannot perform his tasks without risks and endangers road safety. An intensive drive against drunken driving is the need of the hour to promote road safety. It is important to initiate necessary steps to achieve this by overcoming all the challenges. So we have designed an embedded system through which we can control drunken driving.",

To mark this event, various events will be organized which includes ROBODANGAL, Water Rocket Championship and online quizzing competition. An interactive guest lecture will also be organized by the club. The spotlight of this celebration is the Alumni Meet of the club.  <br><br>ROBODANGAL : Dangal means a reserved area which is meant for free style Indian wrestling. A match is fought between two individuals, the one who stands till the last in the arena is the winner of the event. The event ROBODANGAL is thus based on this theme. Where the teams have to make a robot that will push, lift, move, pull or drag its opponent robot out of the arena, aka AKHADA. The ultimate goal of the robot is to give its opponent a DHOBI PACHHAAD.  <br><br>Water Rocket Championship : The \"Water Rocket Challenge\" explores the principle of rocket. The teams will have to construct and launch a rocket made from bottles that is powered by a combination of water and compressed air.<br><br>Online Quizzing Competition : An online quizzing competition based on exciting topics will also be organized. <br><br>ALUMNI MEET : A day devoted to those who have been an integral part of AMURoboclub. It will be organized on 14th October 2018 from 10:00 a.m. Anyone who have graduated in 2018 or before and have ever been a part of AMURoboclub can attend this meet.<br><br>BIG 3.0 : AMURoboclub in collaboration with its alumni announce BIG Q 3.0. The contest is open for all AMU students. The objective of this contest is to give a pathway to students who wish to create and innovate something new by providing technical mentorship and resources from AMURoboclub. In this third version of BIG Q , the theme is to design and implement a device on the Internet of Things (IoT) in which your device contributes in the fields of agriculture, energy conservation or problem related to real world.",
